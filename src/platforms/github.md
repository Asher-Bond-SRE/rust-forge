# GitHub

GitHub is where the Rust project hosts all of its code, as well as large parts
of its discussions.

## rust-lang organization policy

The following is the policy for management of the [`rust-lang`] organization.

### Access

All access to the `rust-lang` GitHub organization is managed via the [`team` repository][team][^team-policy]. Teams that want to assign access levels, or create new repositories should open a Pull Request to that repository to request the change.

The [Infrastructure Team] is responsible for overall administration of the `rust-lang` GitHub organization. Selected members of the Infrastructure Team may be organization owners if their work requires it.

All GitHub accounts used to interact with the Rust-Lang GitHub organization (owner or non-owner) must have [2FA] enabled. This is enforced by GitHub.

Bot accounts controlled by the Infrastructure Team (such as the triagebot) can be granted any level of access required for them to work at the discretion of the Infrastructure Team.

[^team-policy]: See [Team Maintenance](../infra/team-maintenance.md) for policy on how the team repo is managed.
