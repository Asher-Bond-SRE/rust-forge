# Libs

This section documents meta processes by the Libs team.

## Where to find us

The [`rust-lang/libs-team`](https://github.com/rust-lang/libs-team) GitHub repository is the home of the Libs team.
It has details on current project groups, upcoming meetings, and the status of tracking issues.

The Libs team hangs out primarily in [the rust-lang Zulip](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/) these days in the `#t-libs` stream.

You can also find out more details about [Zulip and how the Rust community uses it](../../platforms/zulip.html).
